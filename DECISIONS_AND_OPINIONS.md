1. The authentication process is not safe because it uses an unsafe, constant and non-expiring value to authenticate (userID).
For the authentication, we should use a token that expires and renews from time to time, or at least an encrypted/hashed login information with password. I would suggest those changes ASAP, delaying the deploy or not deploying the app at all before this is fixed and tested. Obviously this is not the case for this test. This is also true to database authentication.

2. As the app grows (or even at this moment), it is a good idea to split the different models and routers into their own structures, as to separate concerns and make the project more scalable and maintainable. The same is true for the API itself, which can be separated into different routers, but since there are many ways to do this separation of concerns, it's up to the dev team to decide which guidelines this structure should follow.

One approach I think is good is to separate the folders by feature, so that Model, Handlers, Middleware, etc., related to a single feature, are all contained in the same structure. i.e. admin.handler.js + admin.model.js + admin.middleware.js, are all contained inside "src/(handlers/api/routes/etc)/admin" folder. These decisions should be made before writing the code and should be discussed with the team in order to avoid refactoring later on. For small projects like this one, this is not a problem, and it's even better and faster to work with a simple separation, as long as everything is clean, readable and still scalable following good practices (KISS, DRY, SOLID, etc), but I implemented this approach anyway to show what I would do in a bigger project.

3. I've added my prefered linting options, not following a popular guideline. Usage of Prettier or other formatter can be considered, but I personally don't like to use them, as a custom indentation can be used to make the code more readable and these tools make this approach painful.

4. Even though it's not a syntax or logic error to execute a function before its declaration, thanks to hoisting in Javascript, it's a good practice to use it after it's been declared. In most cases, functions should not even be declared in the same block of code, unless it's a callback, a class method or something like that.

5. Sequelize and ESLint helps with formatting and code quality in a lot of ways, like creating interfaces for the data types and preventing undefined variables, but I would strongly suggest using Typescript in any professional project.

6. A request in which the user that tries to access a resource with the correct ID but has no access to that resource will return a 404 by default. This is to avoid providing useful information to potential attackers (IDOR).

7. The "authenticate" middleware in "src/api/router.js", which used to be the "getProfile" middleware, is used in this section because all routes for this test project require basic authentication, but this can be removed for public routes, in which a public router could be created at the same level.

8. It would be good to implement an error handling system to handle error messages properly to the user.

9. Error and Response messages should be translated instead of hardcoded.

10. The routes could be configured in a different way, in which the balance and admin operations would be at the same level or inside Profile related operations, but this requires a better understanding of how the API is going to be used and what are the roles, which is not specified here.

11. For this API it would be a good approach to add a UI visualizer, like Swagger UI.

12. Another important implementation would be unit tests, where applicable, but most importantly, integration tests, making operations to a test database and route to guarantee API integrity.

13. There's no type 'admin' defined or roles for managing the admin roles and using some authorization verification for accessing the resources related to this role. The approach used here just leaves the route available for whoever is "logged" (has a profile_id).
