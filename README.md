1. The requirement here was to create the routes, not the tests or interface, and the time limit did not offer enough time for these extra tasks without impacting in the quality of the code. In a real development environment, the integration tests and an interface for the API would have already been setup and the implemantation would be faster and feasible. If not, a separate task would be required to do these implementations. Since this is not the case, I would have asked for more time to implement the tasks (especially testing) or implement less routes and add testing to each one before commiting the work. Since this fake application deals with payment and sensitive data, it's essential to implement multiple test scenarios and routes should not be available without these precautions.

2. The authentication process is not safe because it uses an unsafe, constant and non-expiring value to authenticate (userID).
For the authentication, we should use a token that expires and renews from time to time, or at least an encrypted/hashed login information with password. I would suggest those changes ASAP, delaying the deploy or not deploying the app at all before this is fixed and tested. Obviously this is not the case for this test. This is also true for database authentication.

3. As the app grows (or even at this moment), it is a good idea to split the different models and routers into their own structures, as to separate concerns and make the project more scalable and maintainable. The same is true for the API itself, but since there are many ways to do this separation of concerns, it's up to the dev team to decide which guidelines this structure should follow. One approach I think is good is to separate the folders by feature, so that Model, Handlers, Middleware, etc., related to a single feature, are all contained in the same structure. i.e. admin.handler.js + admin.model.js + admin.middleware.js, are all contained inside "src/(handlers/api/routes/etc)/admin" folder. These decisions should be made before writing the code and should be discussed with the team in order to avoid refactoring later on. For small projects like this one, this is not a problem, and it's even better and faster to work with a simple separation, as long as everything is clean, readable and still scalable following good practices (KISS, DRY, SOLID, etc), but I implemented an approach to show code quality without changing too much the original implementation.

4. I've added my prefered linting options, not following a popular guideline. It doesn't have all requirements but it helps with JS implementations.

5. Even though it's not a syntax or logic error to execute a function before its declaration, thanks to hoisting in Javascript, it's a good practice to use it after it's been declared. In most cases, functions should not be declared in the same block of code, unless it's a callback, a class method or something like that.

6. Sequelize and ESLint helps with formatting and code quality in a lot of ways, like creating interfaces for the data types and preventing undefined variables, but I would strongly suggest using Typescript in any professional project.

7. A request in which the user that tries to access a resource with the correct ID but has no access to that resource will return a 404 by default. This is to avoid providing useful information to potential attackers (IDOR).

8. The "authenticate" middleware in "src/api/router.js", which used to be the "getProfile" middleware, is used in this section because all routes for this test project require basic authentication, but this can be removed for public routes, and a public router module could be created at the same level without this verification.

9. It would be good to implement an error handling system to handle error messages properly. I've used the approach to return a 500 error code without information, since database and server errors can expose sensitive information to potential attackers.

10. Error and Response messages should be translated instead of hardcoded. Localization is essential for global projects and a good idea for local projects. This could be done in the front and/or back-end, but since the idea here is to build an API, it's a better idea to do the translations in the API itself, allowing for the users to send the language code with the request.

11. The routes could be configured in a different way, in which the balance and admin operations would be at the same level or inside Profile related operations, but this requires a better understanding of how the API is going to be used and what are the roles, which is not specified by this task.

12. For this API it would be a good approach to add a UI visualizer, like Swagger UI.

13. Another essential implementation would be testing, with unit tests, where applicable, but most importantly, integration tests, making operations to a test database and routes to guarantee API integrity.

14. There's no type 'admin' defined or roles for managing the admin routes and using some authorization verification for accessing the resources related to this role. The approach used here just leaves the route available for whoever is "logged" (has a profile_id).

15. Each request could have it's own extension of a Request interface declared with Typescript, from an original Request interface implemented by this project containing profile and other important information that is always available.

16. A lot of concepts were added to this project to showcase experience. This was not required, so a simpler implementation with more features could be considered. I didn't do it this way, since creating features is easy and anyone can type random words until a feature pops up, but making the project scalable and readable is not as simple.
